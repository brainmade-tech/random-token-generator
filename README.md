# random-token-generator
Sample app that generates a big number of random tokens with a fixed size and stores them in database. The purpose of this code is to show you how to generate a token with a fixed size using letters, file handling, interacting with database and finally handling errors. This code is not a perfect one, however, the main idea is to share what I've learned with others.
